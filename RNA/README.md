# Rosalind Challenge: RNA (Transcribing DNA into RNA)
This repository contains my solution to the **"RNA"** problem from the [Rosalind bioinformatics challenge](https://rosalind.info/problems/rna/).
Given a DNA string `t` of 1000 nucleotides maximum, return its transcribed RNA string, with all instances of nucelotide `'T'` that occur in `t` replaced with `'U'`.
