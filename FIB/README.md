# Rosalind Challenge: FIB (Rabbits and Recurrence Relations)
This repository contains my solution to the **"FIB"** problem from the [Rosalind bioinformatics challenge](https://rosalind.info/problems/fib/).
This program calculates the number of rabbit pairs after `n` months, where each reproduction-age pair produces `k` new pairs every month by invoking a variation of the Fibonacci sequence.
