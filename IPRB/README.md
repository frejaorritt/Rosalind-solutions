# Rosalind Challenge: IPRB (Mendel's First Law)
This repository contains my solution to the **"IPRB"** problem from the [Rosalind bioinformatics challenge](https://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/).
This program computes the probability that a randomly selected mating pair will produce an individual with **at least one dominant allele** (i.e., the dominant phenotype).
